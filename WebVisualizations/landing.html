<h3>Summary: Latitude vs X</h3>
<p>The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish
  this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.
</p>
<p>After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude . Factors
  we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, windspeed, and humidity. This site provies the source 
  data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanatins and descriptions of any trends
  and correlations witnessed.
